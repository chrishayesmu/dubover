# dubover

dubover is a GreaseMonkey- and TamperMonkey-compatible userscript. It provides various enhancements to the interface of [dubtrack.fm](https://www.dubtrack.fm). These enhancements are user-controllable via a settings menu.

Some of the available functionality includes:

* Preventing images from auto-loading in the chat box
* Hiding the comment box which appears under YouTube videos
* Hiding the video chat options altogether
* Moving the list of users in the room from a separate tab to beneath the video
* Showing usernames instead of dub counts in the list of users
* Customizable formatting of chat timestamps
* Improved visibility of chat timestamps, as well as the ability to show timestamps all the time and not just on hover
